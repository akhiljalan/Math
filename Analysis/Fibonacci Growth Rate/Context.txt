This set of notes was part birthday present to my younger brother, who was turning 14 on that day (I don't think he was a big fan). It was a challenge to attempt to explain the proof without any notion of limits or sequences, so I tried my best but perhaps made it too inaccessible. Regardless, I felt was a good exercise since proofs often get bound up in formalism and mathematical writing often seems to be a competition of who can be the most esoteric and unclear.
